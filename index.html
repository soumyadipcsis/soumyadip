<p>
We focus on some aspects related to modeling and formal verification of embedded systems. Many models have been proposed to represent embedded systems. These models encompass a broad range of styles, characteristics, and application domains and include the extensions of finite state machines, data flow graphs, communication processes and Petri nets. In this report, we have used a PRES + model (Petri net based Representation for Embedded Systems) as an extension of classical Petri net model that captures computation, concurrency and timing behaviour of embedded systems; it allows systems to be represented in different levels of abstraction and improves expressiveness by allowing the token to carry information. This modeling formalism has a well defined semantics so that it supports a precise representation of system.
</p>

<P>
A typical synthesis flow of complex systems like VLSI circuits or embedded systems comprises several phases. Each phase transforms/refines the input behavioural specification (of the systems to be designed) with a view to optimizing time and physical resources. Behavioural verification involves demonstrating the equivalence between the input behaviour and the final design which is the output of the last phase. In computational terms, it is required to show that all the computations represented by the input behavioural description, and exactly those, are captured by the output description. The input beaviour undergoes several transformations steps before being mapped to an architecture. Our objective is to verify those transformation steps.
</P>

<P>Specifically, we address two issues â€”automated checking of functional equivalence of the transformed optimized behavioural specification to the original one, also referred to in the literature as transformation validation, and comparison of the performance of the timing behaviours of the design before and after the optimizations are applied. While the sequential behaviour can be captured by FSMDs, the parallel behaviour can be easily captured using PRES+. An equivalence checker for FSMD models already exists [4]. 
</P>

<P>
Hence, we have formulated an algorithm to translate a PRES + model into an FSMD model and use existing FSMD equivalence checker. It is to be noted that timing constraints are inconsequential for demonstrating data transformation equivalence between the behaviours which allows us to perform equivalence checking using FSMDs. However, translation of a PRES+ model into the corresponding FSMD model encounters state explosion because the method essentially involves parallel composition of the concurrent transitions in PRES+. Moreover, the state explosion problem is further aggravated due to various possible interleavings of the concurrent transitions, which may come into play when timing analysis is addressed. Therefore, We have formulated a direct equivalence checking between two PRES+ models. As a part of the future work, a comparative study of the two equivalence checking methods, one using FSMDs and the other using PRES + models, will be evolved. Specifically, we intend to address code motion validation for this comparative study.
</P>

<P>
Next we aim at the following enhancements of the PRES+ equivalence checker: (i) incorporation of arrays, (ii) capabilities for loop transformation validation and (iii) synchronization transformation. Another goal is to evolve timing analysis mechanism. Some optimizations target timing performance improvement and some resource utilization. Analysis mechanisms will be evolved for both situations. In the former case, the analysis should demonstrate how much the improvement is. In the latter case, it verifies that the deadlines are not compromised.
